            <h2>What is LaTeX?</h2>
            <p> 
            LaTeX is a Typesetting system used for preparing scientific and
            mathematical document at a high level, it also can be used for
            writing just few pages to a complete books.  LaTeX is widely
            used in the scientific field like mathematics, computer science,
            linguistic, physics and chemistry. it is also used by journalist.
            </p> 

            <p>
            LaTeX is a markup language, and the great thing about markup
            languages is the ability to use what ever text editor you like, at
            the end you will be working with plain text, which is <i>universal
                format</i>. Writing in LaTeX is similar to HTML, you open a
            file and start writing your document and building it using LaTeX
            commands without having to think about formatting. this way you can
            <b>focus</b> more on writing which is much important than how the document
            will look like.
            </p>

            <h2> why learn LaTeX? </h2>
            <p>
            the learning process of LaTeX is kinda hard at the beginning, especially for
            those who haven't worked with markup languages like HTML before. however
            once you get the basic syntax (preamble, packages, Environments, lists, and math formulas)
            writing your document using LaTeX will become a natural process.
            </p>

            <h3>a few reasons why you should try it out:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>the nature of your file</b>: writing in plain text gives you a lot of benefits,
                    using tools like <a href="https://pandoc.org/"><b>Pandoc</b></a> you can easily
                    convert your file from one markup language to another. also you can use
                    tools like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html"><b>sed</b></a>
                    and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/"><b>grep</b></a> to make various text
                    manipulation and editing on your file.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b> math formulas are easy: </b> making mathematics equations and formulas in LaTeX are
                    quite easy, use $ $ for inline equations, \[ \] to display the equation in 
                    a new line. the commands inside these symbols are easy to understand, once you
                    see them, you won't forget them.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b> content is more important than the looking: </b> 
                    &quot;If a document looks good artistically, it is well designed.&quot;
                    this is true if we would hung up our document on the wall, however a document
                    has to be read and not hung up in a picture gallery. readability and understandability 
                    is much more important than the beautiful look, that's what LaTeX tries to achieve. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>it's available on almost any Operating System:</b> the LaTeX engine is
                    available on every OS we use as far as i know. it is available on Linux, BSD,
                    Mac, and Windows. also you have the freedom to use your favorite text Editor for writing,
                    so you are not restricted to a specific WYSIWYG software like Word or LibreOffice.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b> and most important: </b> it's <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/">free.</a>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> where to start: </h2>
            <p>
            first you need to setup your writing environment, my advise is to take a look
            at <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> which is a cloud-based
            LaTeX editor used for writing and publishing scientific document. once you 
            feel comfortable you may consider <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/get/">
                installing</a> TeX-Live distribution on your system and do everything offline.
            </p>

            <p>
            my suggestion is to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-p5XmQHB_JSQvW8_mhBdcwEyxdVX0c1T">
                Luke Smith's</a> playlist to learn the basic elements of the document, you should
            also finish <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials">Overleaf's</a>
            tutorials. another useful resources i found like <a href="https://math.hws.edu/eck/math204/guide2020/02-latex.html">
                using LaTeX for your homework</a> and <a href="https://people.uwec.edu/mbirika/LaTeX_Guide_by_Dan_Guyer.pdf">
                this guide</a> are good and you should definitely check them out.
            </p>

            <p>
            after finishing the above you should be able to make your own templates.
            the rest is up to you, there's a lot of documentation on the internet, if you
            have a problem or you don't know how to do something just search for it.
