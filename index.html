            <h1>hi there! Welcome to my webpage</h1>
            I'm Mohammed Haman, I'm from Libya. I love networking, and I'm interested 
            in Operating Systems and Cryptography. at this time I'm working toward 
            my CCNA.

            <h3>What is the purpose of this Website?</h3>
            <p>
            I always wanted to have my own space on the internet, independent of <i>social media</i>
            platforms, but i didn't have the motivation and knowledge to learn basic HTML and CSS.
            up til this semester i took basic web design classes in college, so i had to make a website
            for the final Exam.
            I will try to keep maintaining this website, maybe add some more information on it, and keep it 
            up to date. I will probably buy a domain and VPS hosting if things went well.
